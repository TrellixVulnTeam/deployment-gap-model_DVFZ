# iso_projects_wide_format

Derived from iso_projects_long_format, this table is about individual ISO projects. Each row represents a single project, with county and ordinance information joined on for convenience. A solar + storage facility, for example, will have entries in both the generation_capacity_mw column and the storage_capacity_mw column.

## Modeling Decisions

This is just a restructured version of iso_projects_long_format, so no additional modeling decisions were made. See iso_projects_long_format for details:
